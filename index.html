	  <h1> Reviews and Comments </h1>
   
    <p>“In this picture book, Collins sensitively examines the impact of war on the very young, using her own family history as a template."
--Publishers Weekly,STARRED REVIEW
<br> <br>
“With a notable lack of patriotic rhetoric or clichés about bravery and honor, Collins holds firm to her childhood memories, creating a universal story for any child whose life is disrupted by war. Important and necessary ."
--Kirkus Reviews,STARRED REVIEW
<br> <br>
“Collins’ unflinching first-person account details the fears and disappointments of the situation as a child would experience them. And where more realistic illustrations would feel overwrought and sentimental, Proimos’s flat, cartoony drawings, with their heavy lines and blocky shapes, are sturdy and sweet, reflecting a child’s clear-eyed innocence."
--Booklist,STARRED REVIEW
<br> <br>
“Proimos’ ink-lined, digitally colored illustrations are the pitch-perfect tonal complement to Collins’ narration, with the family portrayed as wide-eyed, childlike cartoons that carry on with daily life in crayon-bright hues, while young Suzy’s angst-filled imaginings take shape in full-spread, full-bleed gray-tone scenes that twist her innocent favorite animals into recurrent nightmarish motifs and symbols of war. With text and illustrations that invite close reading, this will be a powerful title to share with children well beyond picture-book age."
--The Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books,STARRED REVIEW</p>
